# 6.882: Recreating a Presidential Predictor
Author: Sarah Hensley

Abstract: In this project, we recreate the certain results from [Dynamic Bayesian Forecasting of Presidential Elections in the States](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Dynamic-Bayesian-Forecasting-of-Presidential-in-the-Linzer/f811704722bd2541926c69a4b4f5b9832068895e). This model presents an easily interpretable example of a high-dimensional Bayesian model. We apply Gibbs sampling to recreate two figures to demonstrate the match between our model and the model presented. Overall, the figures appear very similar, though slight differences appear, either due to randomness or missing poll information.
